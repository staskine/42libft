# 42libft
A repository for my libft library. 
This is the first project in the 42 curriculum. It focuses on writing your own functions from some existing functions as well as some the curriculums own useful ones. 
This project was written completely in C and was a good learning experience for problem solving. Each function has their own distinct problems to solve and different aspects to consider. 

Compiling
Download everything in this repository and compile to make a libft.a file that can be used.
